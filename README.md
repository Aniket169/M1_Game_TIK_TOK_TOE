# M1_Game_TIK_TOK_TOE
2. Implement a game in TicTacToeMain 
Complete a console based game--use a new Scanner(System.in)--of tic-tac-toe that plays a game of tic-
tac-toe by asking the user to enter the row and column of their choosing. You game must be in a class named 
TicTacToeMain .  This class will have method public static void main(String[] args) so it 
can be run as a Java application.  For each turn, show the current state of the game. Report a win or tie as 
soon as possible. Tell the user there was an incorrect input if the row or column is out of range until they 
enter a correct choice.  The dialog begins like this (user input for a row and column shows as 1 1): 
 
  Play a game of Tic Tac Toe 
 
  Row and column for X? 1 1 
  _ _ _  
  _ X _  
  _ _ _
